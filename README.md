## Built for IQ analysis and Critical thinking analysis 🧠🚀

🚀 This project is a web-based software that runs on a web architecture built using Flask and hosted on Google Cloud servers. The landing page was designed using Bootstrap, jQuery, and stable libraries.

💻 The software includes features like fast Python, different libraries, login Flask features, and a database authenticated for users to log in. It also includes animations, CSS, 3D graphics, and more.

📝 The entire project was developed in just two days and was designed to accommodate 8,200 users. The feedback received was overwhelmingly positive.

🎉 The project included an event with 10 different challenges ranging from riddles and quizzes to chest challenges and detective-type activities. Participants had to solve the challenges to uncover 10 codes.

🤝 As the sole developer, I am proud to share this project with the community and invite other developers to contribute and improve upon it.
